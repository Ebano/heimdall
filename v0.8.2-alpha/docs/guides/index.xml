In such setup, traefik delegates authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 2XX code, traefik grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. Otherwise, the response from heimdall is returned to the client.
To achieve this, configure traefik</description></item><item><title>NGINX Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/guides/nginx/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:14:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/guides/nginx/</guid><description>NGINX is an HTTP and reverse proxy server which became famous as one of the fastest web servers out there, heimdall can be integrated with by making use of the ngx_http_auth_request_module. In such setup, NGINX delegates authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 2XX code, NGINX grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. If heimdall returns 401 or 403, the access is denied with the corresponding error code.</description></item><item><title>Envoy Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/guides/envoy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 00:13:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/guides/envoy/</guid><description>Envoy is a high performance distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures. When operating heimdall in Decision Operation Mode, integration with Envoy can be achieved by making use of an External Authorization filter. In such setup, Envoy delegates authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 200 OK HTTP code, Envoy grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service.</description></item><item><title>Integration with OPA</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/guides/opa/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 09:00:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/guides/opa/</guid><description>Open Policy Agent, or OPA, is an open source, general purpose policy engine, which decouples authorization, respectively policy decisions from other responsibilities of an application and can be used to implement fine-grained access control for your application. As such it is a very good fit for integrating with heimdall. And indeed, the integration is very simple. It is just a matter of using a Remote Authorizer or a Generic Contextualizer.</description></item></channel></rss>
