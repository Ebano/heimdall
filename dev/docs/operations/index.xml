The following sections provide insights about what can be expected.
Logging in Heimdall Heimdall’s implementation uses zerolog - Zero Allocation JSON Logger, which can however also log in plain text. All emitted log statements include information related to distributed tracing (if tracing is enabled) so that not only log statements can be correlated to traces, but also all log statements belonging to single request/transaction can be correlated as well.</description></item><item><title>Security</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/operations/security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 08:33:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/operations/security/</guid><description>To operate heimdall in a secure way, you should configure heimdall accordingly. Following sections address the corresponding areas.
TLS As documented in Concepts section, the execution of heimdall’s pipeline typically includes communication to other systems. The endpoints of the corresponding systems should be TLS protected. This is however actually out of scope for heimdall. What is in scope, is the verification of the used TLS server certificate, if TLS is used.</description></item></channel></rss>
