Configuration Metrics configuration can be adjusted in the prometheus property, which lives in the metrics property of heimdall&amp;rsquo;s configuration and supports following properties.
Host By making use of the host (string) property, you can specify the TCP/IP address on which heimdall should listen for connections from client applications.</description></item><item><title>Providers</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/rules/providers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 22:13:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/rules/providers/</guid><description>Providers define the sources to load the rule sets from. These make Heimdall&amp;rsquo;s behavior dynamic. All providers, you want to enable for a Heimdall instance must be configured by within the providers section of Heimdall&amp;rsquo;s rules configuration.
Supported providers, including the corresponding configuration options are described below
Filesystem The filesystem provider allows loading of rule sets from a file system. The configuration of this provider goes into the file property. This provider is handy for e.</description></item><item><title>Default Rule</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/rules/default_rule/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 22:13:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/rules/default_rule/</guid><description>Heimdall lets you not only define upstream service specific rules, it does also support a definition of an optional default rule, which, if defined, kicks in, if no other rule matches. This way you can ensure secure defaults by simultaneously reducing the amount of work while defining upstream service API specific rules. That is, an upstream service API specific rule can reuse definitions from the default rule.
The configuration of the default rule can be done by making use of the default property and configuring the following options.</description></item><item><title>Rule Definition</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/rules/rule_definition/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 22:13:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/rules/rule_definition/</guid><description>Rule Configuration A single rule consists of the following properties:
Name Type Mandatory Description id string yes The unique identifier of a rule. It must be unique across all rules. To ensure this it is recommended to let the id include the name of your upstream service, as well as its purpose. E.g. rule:my-service:public-api. url string yes Glob or Regex pattern of the endpoints of your upstream service, which this rule should apply to.</description></item><item><title>Traefik Proxy Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/guides/traefik/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:59:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/guides/traefik/</guid><description>Traefik Proxy is modern HTTP proxy and load balancer for microservices, heimdall can be integrated with via the ForwardAuth Middleware by making use of the available [Decision API]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link index.md %}).
To achieve this,
configure traefik to make use of the aforesaid ForwardAuth middleware by setting the address property to the decision api endpoint and by including the required header name(s), heimdall sets in the HTTP responses into the authResponseHeaders property.</description></item><item><title>Static Configuration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/reference/configuration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:57:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/reference/configuration/</guid><description>Below you can find possible contents (not exhaustive) for Heimdall&amp;rsquo;s config.yaml file. Head over to configuration documentation to get detailed explanation.

The error handlers range from a simple error response to the client which sent the request to sophisticated handlers supporting complex logic and redirects.
The following section describes the available error handler types in more detail.
Error Handler Types Default This error handler is always there and is executed if no other error handler is responsible for the handling of an error.</description></item><item><title>Mutators</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/pipeline/mutators/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:57:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/pipeline/mutators/</guid><description>Mutators finalize the successful execution of the pipeline and transform the available information about the subject into a format expected, respectively required by the upstream service. This ranges from adding a query parameter, to a structured JWT in a specific header.
The following section describes the available mutator types in more detail.
Mutator Types Noop As the name implies, this mutator does nothing. As mutators are the last step in Heimdall&amp;rsquo;s pipeline and transform available subject information into an object required by the upstream service, the usage of this mutator makes only sense in combination with the Noop Authenticator for public APIs.</description></item><item><title>Hydrators</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/pipeline/hydrators/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:57:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/pipeline/hydrators/</guid><description>Hydrators enrich the information about the subject obtained in the authenticator step with further information, required by either the endpoint of the upstream service itself or an authorizer step. This can be handy if the actual authentication system doesn&amp;rsquo;t have all information about the subject (which is usually the case in microservice architectures), or if dynamic information about the subject, like the current location based on the IP address, is required.</description></item><item><title>Authorizers</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/pipeline/authorizers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:57:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/pipeline/authorizers/</guid><description>Authorizers ensure that the subject obtained via an authenticator step has the required permissions to submit the given HTTP request and thus to execute the corresponding logic in the upstream service. E.g. a specific endpoint of the upstream service might only be accessible to a &amp;ldquo;user&amp;rdquo; from the &amp;ldquo;admin&amp;rdquo; group, or to an HTTP request if a specific HTTP header is set.
The following section describes the available authorizer types in more detail.</description></item><item><title>Authenticators</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/pipeline/authenticators/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:56:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/pipeline/authenticators/</guid><description>Authenticators inspect HTTP requests, like the presence of a specific cookie, which represents the authentication object of the subject with the service and execute logic required to verify the authentication status and obtain information about that subject. A subject, could be a user who tries to use particular functionality of the upstream service, a machine (if you have machine-2-machine interaction), or something different. Authenticators ensure the subject has already been authenticated and the information available about it is valid.</description></item><item><title>Configuration Types</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/pipeline/configuration_types/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:56:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/pipeline/configuration_types/</guid><description>Assertions This type enables configuration of required token and claim assertions. Depending on the object type (JWT or introspection response), the assertions apply to different parts of such objects.
Name Type Mandatory Description scopes Scopes Matcher no Required scopes given to the client. audience string array no Required entries in the aud claim. Both cases, either as whitespace separated string, or a JSON array are considered. issuers string array yes Issuers to trust.</description></item><item><title>Tracing</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/observability/tracing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:56:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/observability/tracing/</guid><description>Heimdall allows visualization of call flows in your infrastructure. It does this by using OpenTracing, an open standard designed for distributed tracing.
Following tracing backends are currently supported:
Jaeger Instana Configuration By default, tracing is disabled, but can be configured in the tracing property of heimdall&amp;rsquo;s configuration and supports following properties.
Service Name By setting the service_name (string) property, you can adjust the service name, appearing for Heimdall for your tracing backend.</description></item><item><title>Logging</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/observability/logging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:56:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/configuration/observability/logging/</guid><description>Heimdall logs concern everything that happens to Heimdall itself (startup, configuration, events, shutdown, and so on). Logs are written to stdout by default in text format.
Configuration Logging configuration can be adjusted in the log property of heimdall&amp;rsquo;s configuration and supports following properties.
Format By default, logs are written in text format, which can also be changed by using the format (string) option. Following formats are supported:

By default, Heimdall listens on 0.0.0.0:4456/decisions endpoint for incoming requests in this mode of operation and also configures useful default timeouts. No other options are configured. You can, and should however adjust the configuration for your needs.
Configuration The configuration for the Decision API can be adjusted in the api property of heimdall&amp;rsquo;s configuration and supports following properties.</description></item><item><title>Install from Source</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/introduction/from_source/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 15:54:18 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/docs/introduction/from_source/</guid><description>This document covers how to build heimdall from its source code as well as how to run heimdall using a minimum configuration.
