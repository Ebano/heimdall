description: Those, who are responsible for loading of rules from arbitrary sources.
---

(Explain providers in depth, what do they mean? How are the used? What are they for?)

Also explain what rule sets are and reference the actual existing providers.

== Rule Set Configuration

Heimdall gets the rule sets from link:{{< relref "/docs/rules/providers.adoc" >}}[rule providers], which, depending on the provider, can load rules from a plain old configuration file, residing in the local file system, or even integrate with Kubernetes to load rules from custom resources.

In all cases, a single rule definition adheres to the schema defined in link:{{< relref "/docs/rules/rule.adoc" >}}[rule configuration].

NOTE: Usage of environment variables in rule sets depend on the used provider.
