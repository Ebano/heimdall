description: Those, who are responsible for loading of rules from arbitrary sources.
---

When rules define the behavior in sense of the desired authentication and authorization aspects and are organized in rule sets, then the providers are those entities, which manage the lifecycle of the rule sets.

These are the providers, which load, reload or remove rules when a new rule set appears,  changes are detected, or a rule set is deleted. While all providers are different in the sense that they support different sources to load rule sets from, most of them use the same file-based rule set format.

The following table gives an overview about existing providers
