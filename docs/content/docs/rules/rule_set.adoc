== Rule Set

In principle, a rule set is just a list of rules with some additional meta information. Each `RuleSet` definition has the following attributes if not stated otherwise by a particular link:{{< relref "providers.adoc" >}}[provider]:

* *`version`*: _string_ (mandatory)
+
The version schema of the `RuleSet`. The current version of heimdall supports only the version `1alpha3`.

* *`name`*: _string_ (optional)
+
The name of a rule set. Used only for logging purposes.

* *`rules`*: _link:{{< relref "#_rule_configuration" >}}[Rule Configuration] array_ (mandatory)
+
List of the actual rules.
